# Final Project Presentation - Semi-empirical Thermal Modelling of LAPAN-A3 Satellite Using Machine Learning Method

## Notes

This project is a presentation for my undergraduate final project titled
"Semi-empirical Thermal Modelling of LAPAN-A3 Satellite Using Machine Learning
Method". It uses custom beamer-styled Latex template.

## Instruction

This project requires Latex and R with tinytex package. Then, just run `make`
at the project root directory. If you don't have R with tinytex, install the
required packages noted in `main.tex` and use `pdflatex` to compile it.
